HALF-GAMMON-GAME is a simplified, 
console-based take on backgammon that focuses on core movement and strategy mechanics without all of the full-game complexity. 
Players move pieces around the board according to dice rolls, trying to be the first to bear off their checkers while blocking and hitting their opponent’s pieces. 
This project was built to practice game logic, turn-based flow control, and array/vector manipulation in code, with an emphasis on clean input handling and clear, text-based board display.
